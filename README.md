# I-don-t-know-what-Im-doing

This is a practice file highlighting the fact that I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing
This entire unit was a blur and was very very messed up and unorganized.
If I had the choice I would go back in time just to shoot myself in the head the day before we started GitHub. 
End my suffering.
